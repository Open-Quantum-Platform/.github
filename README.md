# Welcome to the Main Page of Open Quantum Platform

### Mission

This site is dedicated to the development and application of modular computational platform for the general science and technology community. As the old-fashioned approach to developing and maintaining computational programs becomes obsolete, an emerging concept of software modularity offers an elegant and timely solution of the looming problems by providing an open development ecosystem where new computational approaches can be rapidly created from modules uploaded at the web repository by the interested users and developers. The first implementation of such an environment is already available in the form of a web-based platform at ([http://mqcp.edison.re.kr](http://mqcp.edison.re.kr/)).
